ADMM-OL2: The ordered L2-Norm minimization
------------------------------------------------------
1.0 Introduction
--------------

Thank you for downloading the ADMM-OL2 solver!  ADMM-OL2 is a apache spark solver
using Scala for large-scale problem based on ADMM. ADMM-OL2 is adaptive, computationally tractable
and distributed. It is designed to solve the following three problems: 

1. The Ordered Ridge Regression Problem:
   minimize  ||Ax - b||_2  subject to  J_λ(x)

Where J_λ(x) is the ordered L2-norm, the matrix A and vector b can be defined explicily, x is unknown.
